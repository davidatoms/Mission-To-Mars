Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp Module 10 - Scrapping data from NASA and other websites, storing it in a database, and then hosting that database for the world to see. ðŸŒŽ

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to scrape data from NASA about Mars. The next step is to store that in a database, host the database, and then edit the database to show a different rendition of the information that has been scraped. The principles in this lesson are about finding information and data from online sources and incorporating them into the project. Mars is on the radar for exploration, and NASA's website is on the radar for data science exploration, respectively.
